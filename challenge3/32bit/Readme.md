# Challenge 3: Introduction to shellcode development

##Missions
###Mission 1

Can you make the shellcode smaller? How small?

There are several techniques to make the shellcode smaller. These are detailed in John erikson's hacking the art of exploitation. Without going into detail, one can look at print4.asm and see the comments.
###Mission 2

Instead of using the system call write(), use the system call 11 (0xb), "sys\_execve". Start a bash shell instead of printing 'hi there'
###Mission 3

Do the lab above for 64 bit.
