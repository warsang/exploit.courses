## Questions

- What is happening here? Why Are we "admin" if we use a username which is 70 bytes long?

If we use a username that is 70 bytes long the buffer overflows and the overflow rewrites the isAdmin located below it (at a higher adress) on stack.

handleData StackFrame:

High adresses
	|&username
	|&password
	|SIP
	|SFP
	|isAdmin
	|name (If overflown will overwrite isAdmin variable to a value different than 0)
Low adresses

- Why does it crash, if we use a username which is 100 bytes long?

If the username is 100 bytes long, the SIP part of the stack is overwritten. Here we overflow with "A" = 0x41 which implies that SIP is overwritten with 0x41414141
At function exit, eip is told to resume instructions at the value of SIP(0x41414141). This is not an adress where eip can resume instructions hence the segfault.
